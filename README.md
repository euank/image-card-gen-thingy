## image thingy

Poor description, I know.

I'm specifically using this to spit out codenames cards from custom text (in
conjunction with [this](https://github.com/Ryan6578/TTS-Codenames)).

I couldn't think of anything good to name it, so we get no good name.

I'm publishing this as AGPL because people who interact with it deserve the
source code, not because I expect or want any PRs or issues filed.
Feel free to fork if you want to though.
